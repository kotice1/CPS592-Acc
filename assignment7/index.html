        <p>
            First, I created the basic elements of an ordinary Oven. I created functionality to set a timer, to preheat the oven, 
            to set the clock time, and turn off the oven. I then allowed the first test user to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I immediately noticed that when the user did not specify a temperature unit, the response would show “[empty response]”. 
            For example, the user would type, “Preheat the oven to 425”. The response would be “[empty response]”. 
            To fix this I can set the parameter to be required and for the system to ask the user for the temperature including units. 
            Everything else seemed to function properly for the other use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the second test users actions, I noticed the same issue with the units for setting a timer. 
            I fixed this using the same method as before and requiring the parameter and defining a prompt for the missing parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this test I decided to test out using follow-up intents with the functionality to set the clock. 
            So, instead of asking for a required parameter, it says what time it thinks you are trying to set the clock to, 
            then asks if it is correct. If it is, it stops asking questions. If it is not, it recommends the user to try again
             and reminds the user to use am or pm to specify. This was just a different way to go about the same problem using
              a different technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also changed the welcome default to notify the user that they can type help for a list of possible commands. 
            All further tests resulted in no issues going forward.
        </p>
